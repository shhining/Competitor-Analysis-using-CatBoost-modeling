# Competitor-Analysis-CatBoost-modeling
In this project, we do competitor analysis for the candy brand in the dataset, and provide business recommendations at the end.

This dataset contains a representation of household level
transactions over two years from a group of 2,500 households
who are frequent shoppers at a retailer. It contains all of each
householdâ€™s purchases, not just those from a limited number of
categories. For certain households, demographic information as
well as direct marketing contact history are included.
